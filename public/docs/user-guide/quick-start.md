## üìÅ Step 2: Upload Your First File

### Using the Sample File

If you don't have a Sybase file ready, you can use this sample stored procedure:

```sql
-- Sample Sybase Stored Procedure
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerOrders
    @CustomerID INT,
    @StartDate DATETIME,
    @EndDate DATETIME
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT 
        o.OrderID,
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        od.ProductID,
        od.Quantity,
        od.UnitPrice
    FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = @CustomerID
      AND o.OrderDate BETWEEN @StartDate AND @EndDate
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC
END
```

Save this as `sample_procedure.sql` on your computer.

### Upload Process

1. **Click** the "Upload Files" button on the dashboard
2. **Select** your sample file or drag it into the upload area
3. **Choose** AI model:
   - **Default Model**: For quick testing
   - **Gemini AI**: For best quality (recommended)
4. **Click** "Start Conversion"
5. **Wait** for the processing indicator to complete

## üîç Step 3: Review the Conversion

### Understanding the Results

After conversion, you'll see three panels:

#### 1. File Status Panel
- **‚úÖ Success**: Your file converted successfully
- **File size**: Original vs converted file size
- **Conversion time**: How long the process took

#### 2. Code Comparison Panel
- **Left side**: Original Sybase code
- **Right side**: Converted Oracle code
- **Highlighted differences**: Changes are color-coded

#### 3. Issues Panel
- **Warnings**: Items that need attention
- **Suggestions**: Optimization recommendations
- **Notes**: Explanation of changes made

### Sample Conversion Result

Your Sybase procedure will be converted to something like this:

```sql
-- Converted Oracle Stored Procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE GetCustomerOrders(
    p_CustomerID IN NUMBER,
    p_StartDate IN DATE,
    p_EndDate IN DATE,
    p_cursor OUT SYS_REFCURSOR
)
AS
BEGIN
    OPEN p_cursor FOR
    SELECT 
        o.OrderID,
        o.OrderDate,
        o.TotalAmount,
        od.ProductID,
        od.Quantity,
        od.UnitPrice
    FROM Orders o
    INNER JOIN OrderDetails od ON o.OrderID = od.OrderID
    WHERE o.CustomerID = p_CustomerID
      AND o.OrderDate BETWEEN p_StartDate AND p_EndDate
    ORDER BY o.OrderDate DESC;
END GetCustomerOrders;
/
```

### Key Changes to Notice

1. **Parameter syntax**: `@CustomerID` ‚Üí `p_CustomerID IN NUMBER`
2. **Return method**: Added `SYS_REFCURSOR` for result set
3. **Procedure termination**: Added `/` at the end
4. **Variable naming**: Oracle conventions applied
