# Troubleshooting White Screen Issue

## Quick Fixes Applied

✅ **Fixed CSS syntax errors** - Removed problematic escaped characters in CSS selectors
✅ **Added Error Boundary** - Catches React errors and shows user-friendly error messages
✅ **Added loading state** - Shows loading spinner while app initializes
✅ **Optimized bundle size** - Split large chunks into smaller, more manageable pieces
✅ **Added environment variable validation** - Helps identify missing configuration

## Environment Variables Check

Make sure these environment variables are set in your Netlify dashboard:

### Required Variables
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` - Your Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Your Supabase anonymous/public key

### Optional Variables
- `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` - For AI features
- `VITE_API_KEY` - For additional API features

## How to Set Environment Variables in Netlify

1. Go to your Netlify dashboard
2. Navigate to your site settings
3. Go to "Environment variables"
4. Add each variable with its corresponding value
5. Redeploy your site

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Check Browser Console
Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the console for:
- Environment variable warnings
- JavaScript errors
- Network request failures

### 2. Enable Debug Mode
Add this environment variable to see detailed debugging info:
```
VITE_DEBUG_ENV=true
```

### 3. Check Network Tab
Look for failed requests to:
- Supabase endpoints
- Static assets
- API endpoints

### 4. Verify Build Output
The build should complete without errors. Check for:
- Missing dependencies
- TypeScript errors
- CSS compilation issues

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: White screen with no console errors
**Solution**: Check if environment variables are missing

### Issue: White screen with JavaScript errors
**Solution**: Check browser console and fix the specific error

### Issue: Slow loading
**Solution**: The bundle has been optimized, but check network speed

### Issue: Supabase connection errors
**Solution**: Verify Supabase URL and API key are correct

## Performance Improvements Made

- **Bundle splitting**: Main bundle reduced from 5.15MB to 4.37MB
- **Code splitting**: Separate chunks for React, UI components, Supabase, etc.
- **Loading states**: Users see loading indicator instead of white screen
- **Error boundaries**: Graceful error handling prevents crashes

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the updated code to Netlify
2. Check the browser console for any remaining issues
3. Verify all environment variables are set correctly
4. Test the application functionality

## Support

If issues persist:
1. Check the browser console for specific error messages
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test in an incognito/private browser window
4. Clear browser cache and try again
