## Basic Concepts & Overview

### Q: What is the Sybase to Oracle Migration Tool? [Easy]
**A:** An AI-powered web application that converts Sybase database code (SQL, stored procedures, functions, triggers) to Oracle-compatible syntax using Google Gemini AI and advanced conversion algorithms.

### Q: What are the main benefits? [Easy]
**A:** 
- ü§ñ AI-Powered conversion accuracy
- ‚ö° Fast batch processing
- üîç Quality assurance with diff viewer
- üìä Detailed reporting
- üöÄ Direct Oracle deployment
- üë• Team collaboration with role-based access

### Q: What file types are supported? [Easy]
**A:** SQL files (.sql), stored procedures (.sp), functions (.func), triggers (.trg), DDL statements, and database schema files.

### Q: What is the technology stack? [Medium]
**A:** 
- **Frontend:** React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- **Backend:** Supabase, PostgreSQL, Supabase Auth, Edge Functions
- **AI/ML:** Google Gemini AI, LangChain, OpenAI (Optional)
- **Infrastructure:** Docker, Nginx, Cloud Deploy, CI/CD

## System Architecture

### Q: Describe the high-level architecture. [Medium]
**A:** Four-layer architecture:
1. **Client Layer:** React UI components, Monaco Editor, File Uploader
2. **Application Layer:** Auth Context, State Management, Routing
3. **AI Processing Layer:** Gemini AI Integration, LangChain Framework, Conversion Engine
4. **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL Database, Auth Service, File Storage

### Q: How does data flow during migration? [Medium]
**A:** 
1. File Upload ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Database Record
2. Processing Queue ‚Üí AI Conversion ‚Üí Validation
3. Storage & Report ‚Üí User Notification
4. Deployment ‚Üí Oracle Connection ‚Üí Logging

### Q: What are key frontend components? [Medium]
**A:** CodeUploader, ConversionViewer, AdminPanel, ReportViewer, Monaco Editor, Chatbot

---

## Frontend Development

### Q: What React hooks are used? [Medium]
**A:** useAuth(), useAdmin(), useUnreviewedFiles(), useMobile(), useToast()

### Q: How is the diff viewer implemented? [Hard]
**A:** Uses Monaco Editor with custom diff algorithms for side-by-side code comparison with syntax highlighting.

### Q: How is file upload handled? [Medium]
**A:** HTML5 drag-and-drop API with file type validation, size limits (10MB), batch processing (50 files), progress tracking.

---

## Backend & Database

### Q: What is the database schema? [Medium]
**A:** Core tables:
- profiles (user management)
- migrations (session data)
- migration_files (individual conversions)
- migration_reports (generated reports)
- deployment_logs (Oracle deployment tracking)
- admin_logs (audit trail)
- system_settings (configuration)

### Q: How is Row Level Security implemented? [Hard]
**A:** PostgreSQL policies ensure users can only access their own data, while admins have broader access based on role checks.

### Q: How are database triggers used? [Hard]
**A:** Automate progress calculation, timestamp updates, audit logging, and status synchronization.

---

## AI Integration & Processing

### Q: How is Gemini AI integrated? [Hard]
**A:** Direct API calls with structured prompts, LangChain framework for workflow management, context building with syntax patterns, response processing and validation.

### Q: What is the conversion process flow? [Medium]
**A:** 
1. Parse Sybase Code
2. Apply AI Conversion
3. Post-Processing
4. Validation
5. Report Generation

### Q: How is the AI chatbot implemented? [Medium]
**A:** Context-aware responses, code analysis capabilities, pre-built questions, real-time WebSocket communication, integration with conversion AI models.

---

## Deployment & Infrastructure

### Q: How is Docker deployment configured? [Medium]
**A:** Multi-stage build with Node.js builder and Nginx server, optimized for production with proper asset serving.

### Q: What environment variables are required? [Medium]
**A:** VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY, NODE_ENV, VITE_METRICS_ENABLED

### Q: How is CI/CD implemented? [Hard]
**A:** Build stage (TypeScript compilation), test stage (unit/integration tests), security scanning, automated deployment, health checks.

---

## Security & Authentication

### Q: How is authentication implemented? [Medium]
**A:** Supabase Auth with JWT tokens, role-based access (user/moderator/admin), social providers, session management, strong password policies.

### Q: What security measures protect data? [Hard]
**A:** Encrypted storage, HTTPS/TLS, input validation, SQL injection prevention, rate limiting, audit logging.

### Q: How are API endpoints secured? [Hard]
**A:** JWT validation middleware, role-based authorization, rate limiting, CORS configuration, input sanitization.

---

## Performance & Optimization

### Q: How is the Performance Dashboard implemented? [Hard]
**A:** Tracks conversion metrics, system performance, user analytics, real-time updates (30s), alert system for performance issues.

### Q: What caching strategies are used? [Hard]
**A:** AI response caching, file storage CDN, database query caching, browser caching, cache warming for common conversions.

### Q: How is batch processing optimized? [Expert]
**A:** Parallel processing, priority-based queues, resource pooling, real-time progress tracking, error recovery.

---

## Troubleshooting & Debugging

### Q: What are common issues and solutions? [Medium]
**A:** 
- AI API Rate Limits ‚Üí Exponential backoff and queuing
- Large File Processing ‚Üí Chunking and segmentation
